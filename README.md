# Titanic Survival Prediction   

A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using Logistic Regression.  

##  Dataset  
The dataset used is the famous **Titanic dataset**, which includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, number of siblings/spouses, parents/children, and survival status.  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Load Dataset** – Read CSV file using pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Encode categorical features like `Sex` and `Embarked`.  
4. **Model Training** – Train a Logistic Regression classifier using Scikit-Learn.  
5. **Evaluation** – Check model accuracy, classification report, and visualize confusion matrix.  

##  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn
